# turbo-giggle

First time

Hi fellow coders, Im Rudenko71 i am new to coding and i am hoping to make this into a career in the future once i get the hang of it. 
I have always been into computers and use them a lot in my hobby as a music producer, i have always wondered how to build websites and apps and i was always put off by the sight of the strange language called code.

However i have decided to bite the bullet and dive into this world and hopefully make a success of it.
